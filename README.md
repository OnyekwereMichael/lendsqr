Project Overview
This project is a web application that includes various features like a sidebar navigation, search bar, notification system, user authentication, and responsive design. The application also integrates several tools and libraries such as React, React Router, React Icons, SCSS, and Firebase Authentication.

Technologies Used:
React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React Router: Library for handling routing/navigation in React.


SCSS: For styling with Sass.

Firebase: For authentication.

React Icons: For icons.

React Query: For managing server-state data.

Custom Components: Search Bar, Navbar, Sidebar, etc.

Features Implemented
1. Sidebar Navigation
The sidebar is used for navigation, providing links to different sections of the application. It is conditionally displayed based on the user's authentication state. Additionally, it is responsive, meaning it behaves differently on mobile and desktop screens.

Mobile-First Design: Sidebar can be toggled open or closed using a hamburger menu on mobile.

Link Highlighting: The active route is highlighted to show the current page.

Dynamic Links: The sidebar dynamically renders links based on predefined data (sidebarLinks).

Key Functionality:
Responsive Design: Adjusts layout for mobile screens using SCSS.

Dynamic Link Rendering: Sidebar links are mapped from the sidebarLinks constant array.

Logout Functionality: A logout button is included to sign users out and redirect them to the login page.

2. Navbar
The Navbar is the top section of the application that includes:

Logo: Displayed as a clickable link that can lead to the home page.

Search Bar: A component for searching within the app.

User Avatar: Displayed based on the authenticated user’s email. The avatar initials are derived from the user's email.

Hamburger Menu: For opening the sidebar on mobile.

Key Functionality:
Responsive: Navbar adjusts for different screen sizes.

Authentication Handling: Displays user initials when authenticated.

Toggle Sidebar: On mobile, a hamburger menu toggles the sidebar visibility.

3. Authentication
User authentication is implemented using Firebase. Users can log in and out, with the sidebar and other components conditionally displayed based on the authentication state.

Login/Logout: Authentication logic is handled via Firebase's signIn and signOut methods.

Conditional Rendering: The sidebar and navbar are hidden on the login and signup pages to keep the UI clean.

Key Functionality:
Sign Out: The handleLogout function signs the user out and redirects to the login page.

Firebase Authentication: Uses Firebase authentication to handle user login state.

4. Mobile Sidebar Toggle
On mobile screens, the sidebar is hidden by default and can be toggled open or closed using a hamburger menu. When open, the sidebar contains the same links as the desktop version, but in a more compact, mobile-friendly format.

Close Button (Cancel): A close button (HiX from React Icons) is implemented to close the sidebar when clicked.

Key Functionality:
Toggle Sidebar: Open/close the sidebar with a button click.

Overlay: An overlay is displayed when the sidebar is open, clicking which will also close the sidebar.

5. Search Bar
A Search Bar component allows users to search within the application. The search functionality is likely tied to some form of filtered data or API calls (e.g., filtering a list of properties, users, etc.).

Key Functionality:
Input Field: Allows the user to input search queries.

Dynamic Display: The search results are dynamically displayed as the user types (likely via some state update).

6. Responsive Design
Throughout the project, the responsive design ensures that the application works smoothly across multiple devices (mobile, tablet, desktop):

Sidebar: On smaller screens, the sidebar becomes a toggleable menu to save space.

Navbar: The navbar adjusts to show a hamburger menu on mobile.

CSS/SCSS: Custom SCSS files handle layout changes for different screen sizes.

7. React Icons
Icons are used throughout the application, such as the hamburger menu, notifications, and avatar initials. We use React Icons for a consistent set of high-quality icons.

Icons Used: HiOutlineMenuAlt3 (hamburger), IoMdNotificationsOutline (notifications), HiX (close button), and others for the avatar and UI components.

Component Structure
SideBar.js
Contains the logic for rendering the sidebar. It is designed to be responsive and adapts to both desktop and mobile layouts.

Navbar.js
Contains the main navigation bar, including the logo, search bar, user avatar, and notification icons. It also includes the logic for toggling the mobile sidebar.

MobileSidebar.js
A mobile-friendly version of the sidebar that appears when the hamburger menu is clicked.

SearchBar.js
Handles user input for searching within the app.
